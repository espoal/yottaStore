# Hash Table

Here we describe a hash table optimized for NVMe storage. For 
simplicity, we assume a namespace of 1 TB, and a block size of 4 KB.

If we were to implement a naif hash table, we would face the following
challenges:

- Lots of wasted space
- Needs wear leveling
- Needs arbitrary size
- Needs to handle collisions

## Pointers list

## Memory allocation

## Garbage collection
